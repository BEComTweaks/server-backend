Server Backend for the website

To clone
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/BEComTweaks/server-backend --recursive
```
<sub> Recursive is neccessary due to submodules</sub>

To start server
```cmd
node server.js
```
<sub> On linux and mac run this command with sudo or a program like authbind to allow usage of ports below 1024
Then just go to the local website and download your packs! It will use localhost instead of the actual server ip
