Server Backend for the website

To clone
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/BEComTweaks/server-backend --recursive
```
<sub> Recursive is neccessary due to submodules</sub>

To start server
```cmd
node server.js
```
Then just go to the local website and download your packs! It will use localhost instead of the actual server ip
